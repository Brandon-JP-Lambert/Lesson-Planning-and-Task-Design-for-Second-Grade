# Lesson-Planning-and-Task-Design-for-Second-Grade

Welcome to the "2nd Grade Lesson Planning & Task Design Resource Generator" repository! This tool is designed to assist second-grade teachers in using AI models like ChatGPT to generate a variety of resources for lesson planning and task design. The output will provide a holistic approach, encompassing storytelling, vocabulary, math problems, poetry, grammar, and social emotional learning (SEL) activities.

## Features

This repository includes:

1. **Storytelling Prompt**: A prompt to create a short story for second graders, focusing on empathy.

2. **Vocabulary List Generator**: A prompt to generate a vocab list to support independent reading of the story.

3. **Math Word Problem Creator**: Prompts to transform each word into a math word problem appropriate for 2nd grade.

4. **Poetry Prompts**: A prompt to create a short, child-friendly poem for each word.

5. **Grammar Point Identifier & Worksheet Creator**: A prompt to identify grammar points in the poems and create student-facing worksheets based on these points.

6. **SEL Activity Designer**: A prompt to develop a social emotional learning activity using these words, including both a student guide and a teacher's guide.

## Prompts
```
1. Write a short story for second graders about empathy.
2. Generate a vocab list I can provide my 2nd grade students to support reading this story. They should be able to use it independently.
3. Transform each into a math word problem appropriate for 2nd grade.
4. Write a short poem for each word in a style appropriate for 2nd graders. 
5. Identify 3 grammar points appropriate for 2nd grade where there are examples present in the poems above. Create a student-facing worksheet for my students based on these points.
6. Now, develop a social emotional learning (SEL) activity that involves students using these words. Produce both a student guide and a teacher's guide.
